# Lights, Camera, Action! for Dalamud (formerly known as Camera Loader)

Lights, Camera, Action! or LCAction, lets you save unlimited camera & lighting configurations/presets in GPose at a time, vastly improving over the vanilla feature which lets you save only one of each. This makes taking quality screenshots easier and more consistent.

For obvious reasons, you need to be in Group Pose to use the plugin.

# Settings

A Camera preset stores the following information:

- Position mode (This is known in GPose as Character/Camera Position, under Save Preferences)
- Distance from the player, or simply Zoom
- Horizontal rotation angle (Affected by the aforementioned position mode)
- Vertical rotation angle
- Field of View
- Roll angle
- Pan & Tilt (Mentioned on the blue instructions window within GPose)

Note that 3rd Person Camera Angle (The setting found in Character Configuration) is not saved.

A Lighting preset stores the following information:

- Position mode, see above
- Information about each of the 3 lights:
  - Whether the light is active or not
  - Horizontal rotation angle (Affected by position mode)
  - Relative position to the player
  - RGB values and light type (Size)
