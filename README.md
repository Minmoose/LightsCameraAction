# CameraLoader for Dalamud
Ever wished you could save multiple camera presets at any given time?

This plugin lets you save unlimited camera configurations/presets in GPose at a time, vastly improving over the vanilla feature which lets you save only one. This makes taking quality screenshots easier and more consistent.

(Only useable within GPose. You cannot use the plugin in regular gameplay because things will probably break)

# Settings
A preset includes:
* Relativity mode (This is known in GPose as Character/Camera Position, under Save Preferences)
* Distance from the player, or simply Zoom
* Horizontal rotation angle (Affected by the aforementioned relativity mode)
* Vertical rotation angle
* FoV
* Roll angle
* Pan & Tilt (Mentioned on the blue instructions window within GPose)

Note that 3rd Person Camera Angle (The setting found in Character Configuration) is not saved.
